# TheBrainGame
A 3D cellular automaton where each cell exists in one of two states: resting (0) or spiking (1).
Each cell has a unique threshold (0-7) and six unique connections, one for each adjacent neighbor.
Connections can be either excitatory (+1) or inhibitory (-1).
A cell's state is determined by computing the dot product of its connections and their corresponding neighbor states.
If the result meets or exceeds the cellâ€™s threshold, it spikes (1). Otherwise, it rests (0).
